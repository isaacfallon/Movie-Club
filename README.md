## Description
            
This project is a full-stack community-focused movie reviewing application which follows the MVC (Model–view–controller) paradigm in its architectural structure. It uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

This application was built so that people could review and discuss films in a community environment similar to a recurring 'book club'.

It was developed by Isaac Fallon, Timothy Wong, Soni Poudel and James Cameron-Taylor.
